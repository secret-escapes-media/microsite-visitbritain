    name: Get Fittie in Aberdeen
    description: Aberdeen is a wild and remote city, a place where riches are made and life is at the mercy of the tumultuous North Sea. Before the oil boom, fishing was the lifeblood of the community. Hidden in plain sight, this old way of life is laid out in the old-world alleys and nooks of Fittie, or Footdee. Missed by most visitors, this quirky community resides in the old fishermen’s housing, where a colourful collection of wooden outhouses and odd-fitting homesteads cluster around narrow streets. Now a rather crafty and artsy area, you’ll find a bunch of curious details adorning the homes and pavements, from folk art to zeitgeisty quips.
