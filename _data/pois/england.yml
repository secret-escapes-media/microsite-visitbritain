    name: Journey to the Holy Island of Lindisfarne, Northumberland
    description: When the tide goes out, drive across the sand of the Holy Island Causeway to the magical island of Lindisfarne off the Northumberland coast. With a recorded history dating back to the 6th century AD, walk in the footsteps of monks, vikings invaders and Norman conquerors as you visit the incredible array of historical landmarks and ruins. Due to the isolated, intertidal nature of the island, Lindisfarne is an ideal escape for those in need of a digital detox, whilst being equally unmissable as a day trip from Northumberland - just remember to check the tides before you visit!

    name: Castle, cathedral and country in Durham
    description: Durham is a wonderfully-historic outpost in the heart of England’s North East. Winding cobbled streets lead down to the river, where the ebb and flow of Durhamites and visitors throng the quaint shops, tearooms and historic pubs of the city’s ancient high streets. All this, in the shadow of Britain’s finest Romanesque Cathedral, which towers over the city drawing visitors to delight at its lofty interior. Don’t miss the stolen remains of the venerable Bede, before heading to that other stone fortress, Durham Castle. Now a university hall, it shelters wonders like the Norman chapel and Black Staircase. Just outside of the city, country delights like Raby Castle and the Durham Heritage Coast tempt visitors away, only to return for dinner in one of Durham’s fine restaurants.

    description: This secluded fishing village is every bit picture-perfect. Cottages and fishing boats are haphazardly slung along the shoreline, all facing the small harbour and its thick walls. Yet this most unassuming place is responsible for one of Britain’s most cherished maritime delicacies - kippers. Craster Kippers, which grace the breakfast table of the Queen often enough, are still smoked here in the traditional way - a centuries-old tradition that you too, can relish in.

    description: Mersey powerhouse Liverpool is known as a hotbed of culture, a bastion of the arts, a characterful city that is set to welcome all visitors with open arms and show them a darn good time. Yet little known, and little-welcoming depending on your disposition, are the subterranean tunnels that run beneath the city streets. The Williamson Tunnels were long forgotten for 200 years, until a local group started digging down into the cavernous and rubble filled spaces. Built by the tobacco trader Joseph Williamson, no one is quite sure what their purpose was. Rumours of an end-of-days cult abound, though you’ll have to make your own mind up as you explore the vast underground network.

On a clear night, you might even catch a glimpse of the Milky Way…

This petite fishing village retains an untouched beauty, one of narrow, cobbled streets lined with ship captains’ ivy-clad cottages, throwback tearooms and artist studios. And no surprise artists flock here; the view of the bay is a rare glimpse into a time gone past, where life was governed by the churning North Sea. A true seaside idyll.

Even better, it’s one of the best places to see the works of David Hockney, not just by virtue of the fact it’s one of the biggest collections, nor that he was local to here and cherished the town, but also that the exhibition is free; rather in the spirit of the Salts Mill.

The thick curtain walls still surround the city and are a great way to circumnavigate the centre of town, before heading deep into the medieval streets of the town. Most visitors will be well versed in navigating the Shambles, a series of tightly-packed shopping streets where Tudor-beamed buildings encroach on the street. But less will know about York’s snickelways - the labyrinthine alleyways that cut through the main thoroughfares. These old medieval snickets share some rather peculiar names - Hole-in-the-Wall, Nether Hornpot Lane, and the curious Mad Alice Lane, which carries its own legend of a scorned lover who poisoned her husband. Take a step back in time and discover a part of York hidden in plain sight.

Oh, and there’s a fantastic pie shop. Disclaimer - Lawrence of Arabia never owned the pie shop, but he did lodge in the building for a number of years after his return from the Middle East. However, tucked away on Steep Hill is Browns Pie Shop, a big locals’ favourite boasting hearty, quality and well-priced fare.

Richard III quickly became the arch villain of the Middle Ages, a murderer of children, a savage, a hunched madman hell bent on power. It is somehow grossly fitting then, that his body would be found under the humdrum concrete of a municipal car park in Leicester. The find was miraculous, with the council quick to open a new visitor centre dedicated to the man and the historic find. Make your own mind up about the king in the car park, with a fascinating exhibition on England’s most notorious villain.

Balti ground zero? The Balti Triangle in Sparkbrook. It all started here in the ‘70s, at stalwart balti houses like Adil’s and Shababs. Both are still firing up the iconic metal pots, artfully blending their spices for devoted customers.

It’s a city that borders the countryside in a rather unique way, lacing its typical high street town affair with rustic charms a-plenty. There is perhaps no better example than the herds of cows that freely frequent the inner-city commons. Just a short hop from your butchers, bakers, post office et al, you’ll stumble on green spaces where cows have priority. Once a common sight across the country, Cambridge is one of the only urban centres to retain this old tradition, one which is wonderfully eccentric.

    name: Explore the untamed beauty of the Roseland Peninsula
    description: Enter this garden of hedgerows and pastures, where typical Cornish beauty rolls across gentle hills and off craggy cliffs. Unpick quiet coves and unspoilt beaches, before heading to Roseland’s heart, the town of St Mawes. This remarkably cosmopolitan spot has become somewhat of a ‘destination’, with a smart set of fine restaurants, boutiques and cafes, all graced by the effortlessly picturesque surroundings.

    description: Begin your Cornish adventure with one of the finest secrets on the stunning southern coastline. From Plymouth, cross into Cornwall on the Torpoint Ferry. The Rame Peninsula unfolds in front of you, a little-known beauty spot where hidden coves and craggy, sea-battered cliffs fringe this Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Head for the idyllic twin villages of Cawsand & Kingsand, leaving the car near the top and walking the narrow lanes of pastel homes. A small smattering of pubs offer fine views over Plymouth Sound.

    name: Hunt for fossils on the Jurassic Coast
    description: This protected stretch of coastline spoils visitors with some of the finest seaside settings in Britain. Beauty spots like Lulworth Cove, Durdle Door and the lofty cliffs of Beer and West Bay are great jumping-off points; but the fun really starts when you start your fossil hunting. If you’re lucky, you’ll score a few ammonites to take home; but patience is key. The best beaches for finding your fossilised souvenir are Charmouth and Lyme Regis.

    name: Treasure hunting in Walcot Village, Bath
    description: Known as the Artisan Quarter, this charming Bath neighbourhood is filled with eclectic shops. Discover your next treasure in a clutch of antique shops, or find something local and handmade in one of the many independent boutiques. Don’t miss the grotesque faces dotted on the wall of The Paragon, some representing characters from local myths, some carvings of real life locals.

    name: City night kayaking down the Avon, Bath
    description: A rather peculiar way of exploring Bath, breeze past the gorgeous Georgian architecture from the slow ebb and flow of the river Avon, as you stand atop your paddleboard for a nighttime - well, paddle. Original Wild offers a range of waterborne experiences, but seeing the frankly beautiful city of Bath lit up at night, whilst also surfing along the river, is an experience not quickly forgotten.
