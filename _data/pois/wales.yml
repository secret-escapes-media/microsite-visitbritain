    name: Take a coastal trip packed with history in North Wales
    description: Where the piercing mountains of Snowdonia meet the sea, you’ll find a coastline of ravishing beauty. Visit the Italianate wonder of Portmeirion, explore the ancient walls of Harlech, Caernarfon and Conwy castles, or sink into a cosy cafe in Barmouth. Head for Bardsey Island, which fosters an incredible amount of history that belies its small size. The Llŷn Peninsula offers true hidden beauty, with a mix of Iron Age hill forts, abundant wildlife and quaint seaside towns like Aberdaron and Abersoch, ripe for exploring.

    name: Cruise on the Llangollen Canal
    description: Hire a narrowboat and drift along this historic canal route. Starting in north-east Wales, navigate the twists and turns of the waterway before floating into the Shropshire countryside, making sure, of course, to pitstop at the various pubs on the way. The highlight of the trip will undoubtedly be the ‘stream in the sky’, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, a bridge over the River Dee that soars high above the valley. Expect some truly epic views (and a hit of adrenaline) as you cross to the other side.

    name: Explore Waterfall Country in Wales
    description: There are some truly spectacular waterfalls in the Vale of Neath.

From the dramatic Sgwd Clun-Gwyn that cascades from one tier into the next, to the spellbinding Sgwd yr Eira curtain where you can actually walk behind the falls, Waterfall Country is a truly magical place.
