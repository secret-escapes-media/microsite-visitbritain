    name: Take a coastal trip packed with history in North Wales
    description: Where the piercing mountains of Snowdonia meet the sea, you’ll find a coastline of ravishing beauty. Visit the Italianate wonder of Portmeirion, explore the ancient walls of Harlech, Caernarfon and Conwy castles, or sink into a cosy cafe in Barmouth. Head for Bardsey Island, which fosters an incredible amount of history that belies its small size. The Llŷn Peninsula offers true hidden beauty, with a mix of Iron Age hill forts, abundant wildlife and quaint seaside towns like Aberdaron and Abersoch, ripe for exploring.

    name: Cruise on the Llangollen Canal
    description: Hire a narrowboat and drift along this historic canal route. Starting in north-east Wales, navigate the twists and turns of the waterway before floating into the Shropshire countryside, making sure, of course, to pitstop at the various pubs on the way. The highlight of the trip will undoubtedly be the ‘stream in the sky’, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, a bridge over the River Dee that soars high above the valley. Expect some truly epic views (and a hit of adrenaline) as you cross to the other side.

    name: Walk ethereal landscapes in Anglesey
    description: Wales’ biggest island offers some truly inspiring landscapes, though few come as beguiling as what lies on Parys Mountain. The Great Opencast is an ancient coppermine, a vast scar on the landscape caused by centuries of pick axes, shovels and gunpowder. What’s left is a craterous lunar panorama that dazzles with a rich palette of colour - purple, green, black and golden hues can all be spied from the perimeter walkway. The views are pretty unique, a world away from the more typical pastoral beauty of this pocket of North Wales.

    name: Splash around the canyons of Glynneath
    description: Head for Glynneath in the beautiful Brecon Beacons for a spot of canyoning. The inland version of coasteering will see you spilling into wild waters, struggling upstream negotiating tricky outcrops, gorges, and a set of magnificent waterfalls. It’s a tough challenge which rewards at every turn – there’s no better way of experiencing the truly rugged nature of this wild landscape.

    description: The Wye is a truly idyllic waterway that cuts from mid-Wales down to the Severn estuary. Hire a canoe from Wye Valley Canoes and discover the beauty of the valley. Half a day will see you gliding into Hay-on-Wye, a remarkable stop. Or, head south and discover Monmouth with a stopover. Tintern Abbey and Chepstow Castle sit on the river’s banks further downstream, as the river closes in on the Severn.

    name: Head to the hermit’s home nestled in the Pembrokeshire coastline
    description: It’s a rare thing when a location gives you goosebumps. St Govan’s Chapel is one of those places. Precariously perched halfway down a steep cliff, this tiny stone chapel hugs the weather-beaten rocks, with dramatic views over the sea and cliffs at every turn. The 13th-century chapel marks the place where St Govan lived his days as a hermit, having sheltered here after escaping from pirates and devoting his life to God in return for saving him. The legend adds a fitting mystery to this already magical place.
